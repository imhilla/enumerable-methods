## Enumerable Methods

In this project, i got a chance to dive deeper into Ruby methods. Previously, i learned about the Enumerable module which gets mixed into the Array and Hash classes (among others) and provides you with lots of handy iterator methods.

First i created a script file to house my custom methods and ran it in IRB to test them.
Added my new methods onto the existing Enumerable module. Ruby makes this easy because any class or module can be added to without trouble ... just do something like:

module Enumerable
    def my_each
      # your code here
    end
  end

Created #my_each, a method that is identical to #each.

Created #my_each_with_index in the same way.

Created #my_select in the same way

Created #my_all?

Created #my_any?

Created #my_none?

Created #my_count

Created #my_map

Created #my_inject


Lastly, i added examples to show that the methods works same us the inbuilt methods Ruby offers.
